# REC-Email

Hello REC members!

Here's the template for the emails we send out, and a quick guide on how to begin editing it for your own purposes. 

# Cloning the File (a.k.a getting it onto your computer)

1. On the top right, click on the green button "Clone or download". Proceed to download it by choosing the "Download ZIP" option. 
2. Once donwloaded, use your favorite editor, or download VS Code from (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to open the "email.html" file. 
3. Now you can begin editing. 

# Making Those Edits

1. I've divided the HTML email template into a couple different sections, indicated by the comments so you know where they are. 
2. The basic gist of things is – if you want to edit the text of something, edit it within the "td" tags. And if you want to create a new section header, you would copy the entire section header part (indicated by SECTION HEADER and END SECTION HEADER) and paste it beneath. 
3. For styling – place words within "b" tags to make them bold, "i" tags to make them italic, and "u" tags to underline them. 
4. You would also want to know how to line break (go to the next line/have a space in between paragraphs) by using "br" in between your text.

e.g. 
in the code: 
"td" this is one "br" now two lines "/td"

in the email: 
this is one
now two lines

# Sending Out the Email

1. Once you're done, open up email.html in your preferred browser, and use CTRL + A or CMD + A to select the entire page and copy and paste it onto your email. 
2. Be sure to test it before sending it out!
